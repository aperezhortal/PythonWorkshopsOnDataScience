Workshop series on Atmospheric Data Science
===========================================

This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks used in a (very short) series of Workshops organized by the students in
the Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences department at McGill University.
It worth mentioning that this repository does not contain a full course on Atmospheric Data Science.

The workshop series were aimed (but not limited to) atmospheric sciences students interested in learning how to
analyze big data sets using Python, an open source programing language.
Since each workshop had a short duration (2 to 3 hours), only an introduction to each of the following topics was
presented:

* Getting comfortable with python
* Numpy and Pandas
* Storytelling through visualization
* Introduction to Pandas
* Introduction to Xarray
* Example of a simple data science project
* Parameterize convection using neural networks (partially completed)

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before attending the workshop you should have installed in your computer the Jupyter notebook,
and interactive terminal that allows to combine into a single document the execute python code,
formatted text, and graphics.
The recommended way to install the Jupyter Notebook is through the anaconda distribution.
A full guide to install the anaconda python distribution and the Jupyter notebook can be found
at https://medium.com/@neuralnets/beginners-quick-guide-for-handling-issues-launching-jupyter-notebook-for-python-using-anaconda-8be3d57a209b
.


Another alternative is using Google’s Colaboratory, a research tool for machine
learning education and research. It’s a Jupyter notebook environment that
runs on the cloud (only a web browser and a google account is needed) and
requires no setup to use. See more at
