    "================================\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Semantics\n",
    "\n",
    "Indentation: Whitespace Matters!\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we get to the main block of code:\n",
    "\n",
    "for i in range(10):\n",
    "    if i < midpoint:\n",
    "        lower.append(i)\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        upper.append(i)\n",
    "\n",
    "        \n",
    "## Whitespace *Within* Lines Does Not Matter\n",
    "While the mantra of *meaningful whitespace* holds true for whitespace *before* lines (which indicate a code block), white space *within* lines of Python code does not matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Everything Is an Object!\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an object-oriented programming language, and in Python everything is an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What is an object?**: An object is an entity that contains data along with associated metadata and/or functionality. Python is an object-oriented programming language, and in Python everything is an **object**, which means every **entity** has some **metadata (called attributes)** and **associated functionality (called methods)**. These attributes and methods are accessed via the dot syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Variables Are Pointers\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What is a pointer?** A pointer is an object or variable that stores the memory address of another value located in the memory. A pointer references a location in memory where the variable of the object is stored.\n",
    " \n",
    "Assigning variables in Python is as easy as putting a variable name to the left of the equals (``=``) sign:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# assign 4 to the variable x\n",
    "x = 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This may seem straightforward, but if you have the wrong mental model of what this operation does, the way Python works may seem confusing.\n",
    "We'll briefly dig into that here.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many programming languages, variables are best thought of as containers or buckets into which you put data.\n",
    "So in C, for example, when you write\n",
    "\n",
    "```C\n",
    "// C code\n",
    "int x = 4;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "you are essentially defining a \"memory bucket\" named ``x``, and putting the value ``4`` into it.\n",
    "**In Python, by contrast, variables are best thought of not as containers but as pointers.**\n",
    "So in Python, when you write\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "you are essentially defining a *pointer* named ``x`` that points to some other bucket containing the value ``4``.\n",
    "Note one consequence of this: because Python variables just point to various objects, there is no need to \"declare\" the variable, or even require the variable to always point to information of the same type!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "        \n",
    "# Built-In Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen Python's simple types: ``int``, ``float``, ``complex``, ``bool``, ``str``, and so on.\n",
    "Python also has several built-in compound types, which act as containers for other types.\n",
    "These compound types are:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Type Name | Example                   |Description                            |\n",
    "|-----------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n",
    "| ``list``  | ``[1, 2, 3]``             | Ordered collection                    |\n",
    "| ``tuple`` | ``(1, 2, 3)``             | Immutable ordered collection          |\n",
    "| ``dict``  | ``{'a':1, 'b':2, 'c':3}`` | Unordered (key,value) mapping         |\n",
    "| ``set``   | ``{1, 2, 3}``             | Unordered collection of unique values |\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, round, square, and curly brackets have distinct meanings when it comes to the type of collection produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dictionaries\n",
    "Dictionaries are extremely flexible mappings of keys to values, and form the basis of much of Python's internal implementation.\n",
    "They can be created via a comma-separated list of ``key:value`` pairs within curly braces:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "numbers = {'one':1, 'two':2, 'three':3}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access a value via the key\n",
    "numbers['two']\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set a new key:value pair\n",
    "numbers['ninety'] = 90\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Arithmetic Operations\n",
    "Python implements seven basic binary arithmetic operators, two of which can double as unary operators.\n",
    "They are summarized in the following table:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Operator     | Name           | Description                                            |\n",

    "| ``a * b``    | Multiplication | Product of ``a`` and ``b``                             |\n",
    "| ``a / b``    | True division  | Quotient of ``a`` and ``b``                            |\n",

    "| ``a % b``    | Modulus        | Integer remainder after division of ``a`` by ``b``     |\n",

    "| ``+a``       | Unary plus     | ``a`` unchanged (rarely used)                          |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparison Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Another type of operation which can be very useful is comparison of different values.\n",
    "For this, Python implements standard comparison operators, which return Boolean values ``True`` and ``False``.\n",
    "The comparison operations are listed in the following table:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Operation | Description \n",
    "| ----- | -------- \n",
    "| ``a == b``| ``a`` equal to ``b``\n",
    "| ``a != b``| ``a`` not equal to ``b``\n",
    "| ``a < b`` | ``a`` less than ``b`` \n",
    "| ``a > b`` | ``a`` greater than ``b``\n",
    "| ``a <= b``| ``a`` less than or equal to ``b`` \n",
    "| ``a >= b`` | ``a`` greater than or equal to ``b`` \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Control Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conditional Statements: ``if``-``elif``-``else``:\n",
    "Conditional statements, often referred to as *if-then* statements, allow the programmer to execute certain pieces of code depending on some Boolean condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indentation: Whitespace Matters!\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we get to the main block of code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if x==0:\n",
    "    print(\"x is zero)\n",
    "elif x>0:\n",
    "    print(\"x is positive)          \n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"x is negative)\n",
    "```\n",
    "In programming languages, a block of code is a set of statements that should be treated as a unit. In Python, code blocks are denoted by indentation:\n",
    "In Python, indented code blocks are always preceded by a colon (:) on the previous line.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## ``for`` loops\n",
    "Loops in Python are a way to repeatedly execute some code statement.\n",
    "So, for example, if we'd like to print each of the items in a list, we can use a ``for`` loop:"

    "* **ndarray.size** : the total number of elements of the array. This is equal to the product of the elements of shape.\n",
    "* **ndarray.dtype** : an object describing the type of the elements in the array. One can create or specify dtype’s using standard Python types. Additionally NumPy provides types of its own. numpy.int32, numpy.int16, and numpy.float64 are some examples.\n",
    "* **ndarray.itemsize**: the size in bytes of each element of the array. For example, an array of elements of type float64 has itemsize 8 (=64/8), while one of type complex32 has itemsize 4 (=32/8). It is equivalent to ndarray.dtype.itemsize.\n",
